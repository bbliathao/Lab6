To start, we will generate a random interger between interger between 1 and 20, and
based on the result of the random numbers, we check to see if it falls under certain range
if the number is > than 15, then the results will be "Cherries"
otherwise if the number is > 10, then the results will be "Orange"
otherwise if the number is > 5, then the results will be "Plum"
otherwise if the number is > 2, then the results will be "Melon"
otherwise, if the number is > 1, then the results will be "Bell"
If the number is not any of the above,  then the results will be "Bar"

we iterate over using a loop three times and print the results to the user. As an example "Plum Cherries"
